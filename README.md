# em3rge

## About

The title of the project, "em3rge" is a playful combination of its intended function simulating emergence, the concept of simple rules dictating complicated behaviours, and the 3D interface intended for the final product.

The project was heavily inspired by Tom Mohr's [Particle Life](https://github.com/tom-mohr/particle-life-app).
It was created as the second-semester project for Advanced Computer Science Topics/Principles (COM335/161).
